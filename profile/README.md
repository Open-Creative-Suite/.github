## What Is Open Creative Suite?

A modular, open source suite of professional grade creative apps for photographers, designers, video editors and publishers built from the ground up with speed, simplicity and freedom in mind.

Each app follows a minimal, consistent UI like Adobe’s, but with:

* No online features
* No AI
* No vendor lock-in
* Fully offline, fully open

##  Project Status

This is a **vision stage project**. I’m not a developer.
I’m a hobbyist photographer & a publisher with a clear creative need and a vision for what this suite can be.

If you're a developer, designer, or FOSS enthusiast and want to build a legacy project for creators: **you’re invited**.
